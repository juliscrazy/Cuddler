# Grab a docker image

Peach images are available on the Docker Hub. You can pull the following tags:
 + julislazy/peach:latest <br>→ the most recent build with the latest commits to the master branch
 + julislazy/peach:dev <br>→ the most recent development build with the latest commits to the develop branch
 + julislazy/peach:[release] (for example `2`, `2.1` or `2.1.1`) <br>→ a specific tag

# How does it work? How can I contribute?

Peach uses a plugin api allowing fairly easy developement of features.
